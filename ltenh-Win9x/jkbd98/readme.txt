 Introduction

   This program generates KBD files for Windows Me/98/95.

   Microsoft wasn't very interested in letting us add to or
   modify the keyboard layout for Windows Me/98/95. Janko's Keyboard
   Generator makes it easy to setup a native Windows Me/98/95
   keyboard layout for any Latin or Cyrillic-written language.
   This new version also features easy setting of "locale ID"
   in the KBD file.


 Installation

    The program is now distributed in a self-installing executable.
    After running this self-installing executable, "Janko" group will be
    added to your Start menu. The program will be placed in Program
    files folder. To uninstall the program, go to the Add/Remove Program
    Control Panel. You can manually move program to some other location,
    and change the shortcuts to it, and the program will still work.
